# AI Content Factory - Operations Portfolio

## Overview
This repository serves as the professional documentation hub for my AI-driven content creation program. The core of this program is managed through a comprehensive and functional dashboard built in Notion.

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Design and implement program management systems from scratch.
- Document complex processes and create clear strategic charters.
- Manage multiple project streams using Agile methodologies (Kanban).
- Leverage a modern tech stack for automation and efficiency.
